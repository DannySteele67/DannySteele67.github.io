    <p>I'm a huge fan of <strong>fighting games</strong>. One of the more technical aspects of these games that I find fascinating
        is the way most developers implement a fighting game's <strong>netcode</strong> now a days. The arguably best, and most used
        netocode for these games is called <strong>Rollback Netcode</strong>. It works esentially by <strong>predicting</strong> a player's 
        inputs and playing them out on the screen. In the cases when the netcode makes a wrong prediction, the game state will be 
        <strong>rolled back</strong> to the frame where the player made that input and correct the action happening on the screen. 
        This may seem like it would be disorienting to the player, but since these predictions are being made <strong>frame by frame</strong>
        the outcome is actually a very smooth online experience. If you want more detailed information about Rollback Netcode, you can
